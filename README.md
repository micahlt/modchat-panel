## What is Modchat?

Modchat is a moderated chat webapp designed for creators on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/). The primary goal is to create a center to hang out, work on projects, and meet new people all while following Scratch's [Community Guidelines](https://scratch.mit.edu/community_guidelines). Since Scratch is designed for children, all images and text must be moderated very strictly. The user interface should be accessible and easy to navigate.

This repository holds the moderation panel code, which is a Vue 3 app bundled with Vite.  The frontend and backend (which you'll probably want for working with this) can be found in the [micahlt/modchat-vue](https://github.com/micahlt/modchat-vue) and [micahlt/modchat-server](https://github.com/micahlt/modchat-server) repos. The project follows the [all-contributors specification](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/specification).
